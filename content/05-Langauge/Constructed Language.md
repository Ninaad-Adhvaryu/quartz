[PDF](https://thesis.eur.nl/pub/43718/Schuttevaar.pdf): Natural language and artificial languages (mathematic, logic, metalanguages) are categorically different. Nevertheless, we attribute exactly those properties to natural language as those that artificial languages actually have. The reason for this mis-attribution, is our experience and perception of natural language. This paper elucidates these claims with Azzouni's work, and subsequently provides normative guidelines for artificial languages that should help prevent resulting errors.
