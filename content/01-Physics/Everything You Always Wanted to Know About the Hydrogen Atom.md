*But Were Afraid to Ask*

We will be reviewing the structure of the hydrogen atom, emphasising on the [[quantum principles]] rather than calculations.

We will look at the how the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] relates to the [[hydrogen atom]]. Then we will look at the [[energy level]] structure, including the [[fine structure]].   Finally, smaller-order corrections, [[Lamb shift]], [[hyperfine structure]], [[Zeeman effect]], will be discussed.

## [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]

$$ \delta x \space \delta p_{x} \approx h $$
where, $\delta x$ and $\delta p_x$ are the x-component of position and [[momentum]] of a particle, respectively.

Consider an electron in a circular orbit in the xy-plane.
