We consider a dBEC composed of atoms with mass M and magnetic dipole moment Âµm.

The dBEC is confined within a three-dimensional trap segregated into two parts by a ring-shaped potential barrier.

Two types of potential are considered
- Flat Trap, created via a [[digital micromirror device (DMD)]]
- [[Harmonic trap]]

Another potential barrier, $V_{defect}$, is also present

In the Harmonic trap

$$
V_{Trap} = V_{har} + V_{ring} + V_{defect}
$$
In the flat trap

$$
V_{Trap} = V_{DMD} + V_{har} + V_{ring} + V_{defect}
$$
---
$$V_{har} = \frac{M}{2} \left ( \sum_{i = x,y,z} \omega_{i}^{2} i^2 \right )$$
$$
V_{DMD} = V_D \left [ tanh \left ( \frac{r-r_{out}}{\sigma} \right ) + 1 \right]
$$
where, $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$

$$
V_{ring} = V_R \cdot exp \left (- \frac{(r-r_0)^2}{2\omega_d^2} \right)
$$
