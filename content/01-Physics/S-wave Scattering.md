The first, lowest energy, mode of the [[partial wave expansion]], under [[Scattering Theory]].

In that case, the differential cross section can be solved, as the [[angular variation]] is $P_0 (cos \theta) = 1$, thus giving the cross-section
$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \|f(\theta )\|^2 = k^{âˆ’2} \sin^2 \delta_0 \nonumber
$$

At higher energies, other [[angular momentum]] components will come into play.

Let's say we have one partial wave contributing the phase shift $\delta_0$ . The cross-section will be 

$$ \sigma = \frac{4 \pi}{k^2} sin^2 \delta_0 $$
and for an finite range potential the cross-section will be finite for all energies. Thus the phase shift $\delta_0$ must vanish with the wave vector $k$. For a small $k$ the phase shift goes $\delta_0 \rightarrow -ka$, where $a$ is a the [[scattering length]].
