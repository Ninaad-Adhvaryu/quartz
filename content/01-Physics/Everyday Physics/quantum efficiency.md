The term quantum efficiently refers to the ratio between an incident [[photon]] and converted [[electron]] in a photosensitive device.  

In a [[charged-coupled device]] (CCD), or indeed any photodetector, it is the ratio between the charge carriers collected at either terminal and the number of photons hitting the device. 

QE is often measured over range of wavelengths, as they energy of a photon differs, to give a measure of device efficiency.

If the photon energy is below the band gap of a [[semiconductor photoreactor]] the QE will be 0. 

A photographic film has QE < 10%, while CCDs may be over < 90%.
