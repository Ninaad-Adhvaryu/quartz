# Film vs. Digital
Film photography uses film—a thin strip of plastic or other material that’s sensitive to light—to take and store pictures.

Film captures photos at a higher resolution than most digital cameras because the resulting photos have more pixels per inch.

Digital image resolution from a standard point-and-shoot digital camera is usually somewhere between 12 and 20 megapixels, which will still yield clear, pretty photographs.

### Image Quality

#### Spatial Resolution

The visual quality of a digital photograph can be evaluated in many ways. 

Pixel count of an image is related to the spatial resolution, it serves as a [[figure of merit]].

The quantity of picture of elements (pixels) in the image sensor is usually counted in millions and called "megapixels". 

Other factors, such as the effect of a [[Bayer pattern]] or other filter on the digital sensor and the image processing algorithm used to interpolate raw sensor data to image pixels.
