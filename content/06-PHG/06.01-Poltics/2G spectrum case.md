A massive scandal involving members of the [[United Progressive Alliance]], then in power in [[India]].



The **2G spectrum case** was a political controversy in which politicians and private officials of the [United Progressive Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Progressive_Alliance "United Progressive Alliance") (UPA) coalition government [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") were allegedly involved in [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G_spectrum_case?useskin=vector#cite_note-1) selling or allotting 122 [2G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G "2G") [spectrum licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_license "Spectrum license") on conditions that provided an advantage to specific telecom operators. [A. Raja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Raja "A. Raja"), then Telecom Minister, was accused of selling 2G spectrum licenses at a very low cost which resulted in the loss of â‚¹1,760 billion (US$25 billion) in government revenue.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G_spectrum_case?useskin=vector#cite_note-2) Raja was also accused of not following rules and regulations as well as not recognizing any advice from the Ministries of [Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India) "Ministry of Finance (India)") and [Law and Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Law_and_Justice_(India)) of India while allotting 2G spectrum licenses to telecom operators. Series of allegations were made on allotting 2G spectrum licenses including allegations from [Central Bureau of Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation) after investigating the case alleging Raja for intentionally advancing the cut-off date (from 01/10/2007 to 25/09/2007)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G_spectrum_case?useskin=vector#cite_note-3) to favour some specific firms ([Unitech Wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitech_Wireless "Unitech Wireless") and Swan Telecom), which were allegedly ineligible for applying for telecom licenses, in return for bribes.

On 21 December 2017, the special court in New Delhi after thorough examination of the case and hearing what the CBI had to say, acquitted all accused in the 2G spectrum case including prime-accused Raja and [Kanimozhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanimozhi "Kanimozhi").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G_spectrum_case?useskin=vector#cite_note-2g_Spectrum_Scam-4) The court ruled that this case was baseless. As per the judgement, "Some people created a scam by artfully arranging a few selected facts and exaggerating things beyond recognition to astronomical levels."[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G_spectrum_case?useskin=vector#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G_spectrum_case?useskin=vector#cite_note-6)

On 19 and 20 March 2018, the [Enforcement Directorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate "Enforcement Directorate") and the CBI respectively filed appeals against this verdict in the [Delhi High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court "Delhi High Court").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G_spectrum_case?useskin=vector#cite_note-autogenerated2-7)

In Feb 2019, Justice Najmi Waziri ordered the defendants to plant 3,000 trees each for seeking more time to file their responses on the appeal challenging their acquittal in the case.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G_spectrum_case?useskin=vector#cite_note-ongoing-8) On 5 October 2020, the High Court will begin day-to-day hearings, which was later shifted to 14 January 2021.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G_spectrum_case?useskin=vector#cite_note-9)
