Had heard about the [[Swedish]] children who where [[catatonic]], from a New Yorker article that is there on Readwise 

But turns out that many children (or all??) were "faking" the symptoms because its easier to get a residence permit as a care-giver.

Can't find a English language source that talks about the faking
