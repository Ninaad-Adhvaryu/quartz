Lateralization of brain function (or hemispheric dominance) is the tendency for some neural functions and cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain.

The human brain is separated by the [[median longitudinal fissure]], into two cerebral hemispheres. They are connected by the [[corpus callosum]].  

Macroscopically, the two hemispheres are identical however slight differences in composition allow for specialised function. 

Lateralization is generally taken with reference to "healthy patients", individual lateralization is unique. 

Note that lateralization and [[Brain#Specialisation|specialisation]] is distinct, lateralization refers to function of one structure divided between two halves.

The best examples of lateralization are [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's areas]], which are both found in the left hemispheres. 
### Lateralized functions

#### Language 

Functions such as grammar, vocabulary and literal meaning are typically lateralized to the left hemisphere, especially in the right-handed.  

Broca's and Wernicke's areas are associated with speech production and comprehension, respectively. 

People who speak multiple languages have separate speech areas for each language.
