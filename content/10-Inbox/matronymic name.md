**name derived from that of a mother or any female ancestor**

Around the world, **matronymic surnames** are far less common than [patronymic surnames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname"). In some cultures in the past, matronymic last names were often given to children of unwed mothers. Or if a woman was especially well known or powerful, her descendants might adopt a matronym based on her name. A matronymic is a derived name, as compared to a [matriname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriname "Matriname"), which is an inherited name from a mother's side of the family, and which is unchanged.
