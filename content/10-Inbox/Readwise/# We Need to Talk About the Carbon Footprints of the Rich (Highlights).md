## Highlights
- They would argue, for instance, that flying multiple times per year to give talks on the climate crisis is offset by the political effects of those talks themselves — their putative power to inspire other people to join the climate movement, pass climate policy or even reduce their own carbon footprints.

    - Note: For detractors, the best activists are ones who are so concerned with there own hypocrisy that they aren't take loud action.
- What can you do, as a single individual, to help halt global heating? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhhqarj57g3b1283ddtqmv0x))
- “Driving” signifies something very different for the American worker at a big-box store who is forced to commute in her car to the mall versus the private equity manager speeding a gleaming Lamborghini around the cliffs of the Italian Riviera. One act is the expression of entanglement in an exploitative economic system that makes it impossible not to emit carbon; the other is the expression of the [injustice](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/04/carbon-footprint-gap-between-rich-poor-expanding-study) of that very system.

- But according to many climate activists, the one thing you should *not* do is discuss people’s personal carbon footprints. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhhqb606hv0x5ettqqtt001a))

- But in these past 30 years, the emissions of the poorest 50% of people have grown hardly at all: They represented a little under 7% of global emissions in 1990, and they remain a little over 7% of global emissions today. By contrast, the richest 10% of people are [responsible](https://oi-files-d8-prod.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/file_attachments/mb-extreme-carbon-inequality-021215-en.pdf) for 52% of cumulative global emissions — and the 1% for a full 15%.

- Of course, many Americans are wealthy in global terms. Oxfam [has defined](https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/621049/rr-carbon-inequality-era-210920-en.pdf?sequence=4) the world’s 1% as the 60 million people earning over $109,000 a year. They defined the 10% as the 770 million people earning over $38,000 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhvyfxtkvas1rtvw06mw0f4f))

- the personal emissions of the top 0.001% — those with at least $[129.2 million](https://wir2022.wid.world/chapter-4/) in wealth — are so large that these people’s individual consumption decisions “can have the same impact as nationwide policy interventions.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhvynz7saktjq3t4bajnyjd5))
- Well, carbon capture doesn’t capture anything close to 100% of power-plant emissions — it still allows global heating to get worse, just at a more gradual pace. You can think of it like maintenance chemotherapy for metastatic cancer ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhvyrzghck4zkxv0yb9jxhsx))
- Resolving the climate crisis will require more than innovation. It will require *remaking* our systems — including our class system, or at least the unequal levels of consumption that our class system justifies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhxkdfm2w3yadfzb669zm0q1))
    - Note: Easier to imagine the end of the world in the end of capitalism.
