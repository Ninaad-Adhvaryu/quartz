## Highlights
- The creator economy is projected to be worth $480 billion by 2027. In many ways, that figure represents an enormous redistribution of wealth: a tide of ad dollars and other revenue ebbing away from established studios and publishers, and flooding toward individual creators and the technology giants that host their work. But the corporations are the only ones on a secure footing in this arrangement. If individual creators want to stay afloat for longer than a brief moment, they still need managers to help them navigate the algorithmic churn.

- Rather than pay one or two famous influencers to use the “Toxic” intro in the hopes of producing a trickle-down effect, the firm appealed to scores of MMA and weightlifting TikTokkers whose followings rarely top more than a few hundred. (Some were given small payments to push the song, but others were happy to do it for free.) Flooding the zone this way caused TikTok’s algorithm to funnel posts featuring “Toxic” into the feeds of users who consume gym-centric content ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hds3m0zsfzmysjk828yvr2fw))
- collaboration between Langevin and SyKo sounded like a prime example of synergy. He said he’d never heard that word before but that he loved it and would be incorporating it into his recruitment spiels from now on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hds3ydsp299rtddn8sbrbrjb))
- “That made me so fucking fearless,” he says. “Like, you know, walking around LA with a bunch of boxes with shoes, and then going into the projects, literally the projects, and convincing these, like, fucking gangsters to buy these knockoff shoes.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hds45psnfdhw1dd2x6dbym9x))

- Magana couldn’t believe he was unfamiliar with such an obvious hit, and he asked a fellow partygoer what it was. “Old Town Road,” by Lil Nas X, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hds4jaew5s137nv2cmwk7z2x))
    - Note: Saw this coming from the "You need 4 versions of a song"
- Every Monday, Magana sends his OnlyFans clients a memo detailing the audio bits they should be re-creating to maximize their odds of jacking into the algorithms—for example, an out-of-context *SpongeBob SquarePants* clip that prompts the reveal of an alluring outfit.

- Magana was elated in the moment. A joint venture would guarantee enough capital to cement 25/7 Media’s long-term viability. But in the days that followed, he became more measured in his assessment. He was worried about ceding some amount of independence, and maybe even equity, to APG, a company that would clearly be the alpha in their relationship. But he also feared that if he passed up the opportunity, he’d never learn the skills necessary to take his clients to the next level. “You know, I won’t know how to get an artist to the Grammys,” he told me. “I won’t know how to get an artist in, like, you know, Nickelodeon Splash events—like, all the mainstream levers.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he0yx4x616jdsjdz26jthamj))
    - Note: I like the writing here.
- Magana says. “And now we’re here talking to you about never having to work another day in your life.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he0z0w9c31x41bfznvf2ftda))
- Magana and Luzi met him at the airport and cued up a playlist of Christian music for the ride to the hotel. But the pastor, who showed up wearing a jewel-encrusted grill on his teeth, demanded that the duo instead blast classics by Young Jeezy. “I see no devil in these boys,” he told Jnhygs’ parents, thus granting final approval for their daughter to become 25/7 Media’s youngest client.

- Keeping his young clients focused on the tasks at hand proved to be a challenge for Magana. “These are kids,” he told me. “Really, we’re just trying to stop them from smoking weed all the time.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he0z5btcnv49vb713xd3ef9q))
    - Note: Parents are going to read this
- Many of 25/7 Media’s clients are ill at ease in the world for poignant reasons. As reflected in the inward-looking content they produce, these young artists see themselves as largely defined by their battles with anxiety and depression. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he0z83aabhs9knc0jy248wj0))
- These mental health issues were compounded by the chaos of the pandemic, an event that Magana refers to, perhaps a bit curiously, as “our generation’s Korean War.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he0z8mwtx0h2myzb40erh2wv))

- Relating to clients can become more difficult after they discover that the fame they crave can’t fix their deeper problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he0zcbg380rwph3khn5gfxvq))

- A teetotaler himself, Magana believes he was well prepared for the demands of fatherhood because he’d already grown accustomed to making sacrifices to protect his troubled artists. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he0zh0m8jq50v2ezsm70me0n))

- But the status quo always becomes less important to decisionmakers when they realize they’re missing out on piles of money. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he0zp3zdsx0v7cpg72fde7rk))
