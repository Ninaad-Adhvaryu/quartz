> Your usage of master's / masters' / masters is confusing. All three are used!!! Since it is one degree, I'd stick to using master. Write MSc Physics instead of International Master, as the latter looks shady, unless that's what will be written on your certificate/ transcript. Relevant courses doesn't make sense, unless elaborated.

I am physics master graduate from the University of Stuttgart. 

My thesis

currently working on Simulations of beyond-mean dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates with Pi5. 

I completed my bachelor’s in physics, with a minor in mathematics, from Shiv Nadar University. I have worked previously with both theoretical and experimental research projects, gaining experience in a range of domains of physics and mathematics. My research interests lie mainly in condensed matter physics and atomic physics; however, I am also open to exploring other related fields. 

I am Physics Master's graduate from the University of Stuttgart.

I am Physics Masters graduate from the University of Stuttgart. My thesis was focused on simulations of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. I have worked previously with both theoretical and experimental research projects, gaining experience in a range of domains of physics and mathematics. My research interests have been focused in atomic physics; however, I am also keenly interested in studying and modelling the mathematical underpinnings of any complex system that has applications across a range of disciplines. 


I am a Physics Masters graduate from the University of Stuttgart, specializing in simulations of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates for my thesis. My experience spans theoretical and experimental research across various domains of physics and mathematics. While my primary research focus has been on atomic physics, I am equally enthusiastic about delving into the mathematical foundations of complex systems which have cross-disciplinary applications.
