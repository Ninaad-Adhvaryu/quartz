[[multiphase flow]] problems occur in many natural systems and technical applications.

In PN 1, we investigate such flow systems with and without wall interaction, inside or adjacent to porous media, or in free-flow domains, ranging from creeping flow to highly turbulent flow.

Here, small-scale interfacial phenomena (transfer of mass, momentum, energy across the interfaces between fluid/solid phases) dominate the overall large-scale system dynamics.

However, purely physics-based modelling for such flow problems has arrived at a substantial barrier. We are convinced that further progress can only be achieved by data-integrated modelling approaches at very small scales, followed by hierarchical modelling and data integration approaches across scales.

The new data-integrated simulation frameworks need corresponding numerical schemes for multi-adaptivity, error control and uncertainty assessment.

### Research Questions

1. **Interface descriptions:** How can we describe detailed interfaces and interface phenomena in [[multiphase flow]] models and simulations, in or outside porous media?
2. **Interface closures:** How to include data-rich interface descriptions in coarser models?
3. **Turbulence closures:** How to advance to a new data-based model generation for turbulent multiphase systems (free flow, interacting with walls or with flows in porous media)?
4. **Applications:** How can we build realistic applications by combining microscopic and mesoscale information, models and data?
