Dear Prof.

I am Ninaad Adhvaryu, I am applying for a PhD position at the Institute for Applied Analysis and Numerical Simulation. 

I have recently completed a Master's in Physics from the University of Stuttgart. 

During my thesis, Dipolar Quantum Gases under Rotation, I worked with Prof. Tilman Pfau, Pi5. The project was numerical, focusing on modifying numerical techniques for finding ground-states of the Gross-Pitaveskii Equation (GPE), a non-linear Schrodinger Equation, that describes Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). I simulated the extended GPE, which includes higher-ordering corrections, and under a rotating frame in order to study the formation of vortices in dipolar BECs. 

The project was involved working with implementations of the alternating-direction implicit method, Fourier pseudo-spectral decomposition and conjugated gradient method within MATLAB.

The project exposed me to both computational and experimental research in physics and I came to realise that my interests lie more towards mathematical modelling. 

During this time, I developed an intertest in the mathematical modelling and it's possibilities. 


I came realise my interests lie primarily within the  simulation frameworks 

I am interested in modelling and simulation of interfacial fluid flow

During the project I realised that it was the underlying mechanics of how we solve problems that I was most interested in, and that the system we were solving was just as relevant as the nature of the problem. 

I have interest in a wide-array of physics. Having worked briefly at with at the iSSELab 

I am drawn to problems that attempt to expand existing techniques with novel approaches possible due to modern computing. 

I am also excited by the opportunity this project affords to explore numerical methods as they apply to more interdisciplinary scientific research. 

I understand the project likely requires some familiarity with Low-level programming languages, which I do not currently have. However, before my thesis I had little experience with MATLAB but was able to learn quickly. Also, I have begin to formally learn C++ and Julia, to help with the transition.

I am writing to express my strong interest in the PhD position at the Institute for Applied Analysis and Numerical Simulation. As a recent graduate with a Master's in Physics from the University of Stuttgart, I am eager to contribute my skills and passion for mathematical modelling.

My master's thesis, under Prof. Tilman Pfau at Pi5, was focused on the numerical modelling of Dipolar Quantum Gases under Rotation. My work involved modifying numerical techniques to study the ground-states of the Gross-Pitaveskii Equation, focusing on Bose-Einstein condensates' behaviour with higher-order corrections and under a rotating frame. Employing MATLAB, I utilized methods such as the alternating-direction implicit method, Fourier pseudo-spectral decomposition, and the conjugate gradient method.

This experience honed my computational skills and also furthered my interest in the fundamental mechanics of problem-solving and the diverse applications of mathematical modelling. 

While my background primarily resides in quantum mechanics, I had the opportunity to work briefly with iSSELab, University of Alberta. A research group that focuses on interfacial fluid dynamics. This experience expanded my horizons and fostered a desire to explore more interdisciplinary areas of physics.

The simulation of interfacial fluid flow combines an interest in numerical schemes with a desire to study systems that lie at the intersection of multiple sciences. 

Anticipating the need for low-level programming language proficiency in this PhD project, I have proactively started formal training in C++ and Julia to complement my existing knowledge in MATLAB and Python.

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to your research efforts and further exploring the frontiers of numerical methods in interdisciplinary scientific research.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and further my academic pursuits at your esteemed institution.

Sincerely,
