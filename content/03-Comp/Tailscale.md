[Tailscale Forum Post about Plex](https://forum.tailscale.com/t/plex-over-tailscale/2023) -- didn't use it as I don't understand but again how it looks at the error logs might be useful

I also did what is talked about in this [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Tailscale/comments/vqdgfy/here_is_the_howtoconfigure_tailscale_subnet/) but I am not sure if that is useful or not
